# Spam Email Classification Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or not spam, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a variety of machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email) and contains labeled emails, allowing for a supervised learning approach.

## Key Objectives
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis by removing noise, tokenizing, and eliminating stopwords.
- Feature Extraction: Transforming the text data into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- Modeling: Training several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and ensemble methods to predict whether an email is spam or not.
- Evaluation: Comparing model performances using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports, and visualizing the results.
- Ensemble Modeling: Implementing an ensemble model combining the predictions of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM to improve classification accuracy.
  
## Results
- Best Performing Model: The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.73%.
- Ensemble Performance: The ensemble of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM did not outperform the standalone SVM model.
- Challenges and Future Work: Cross-validation did not significantly improve the models, and further tuning and optimization of the SVM model is suggested. Future work could explore data augmentation and real-world deployment strategies.
